# Frontend Aplication for Fullstack Todos Application
### React app which is showing data stored in JSON API created with Node.js and MongoDB

This todo list is another step on my way to creating full stack aplications. 
The goal is to create a fully working React app on the frontend which will consume that API and interact with DB. 

The backend part of this application can be found in this repo:
[Node.js Backend for Todos app](https://github.com/wszczawinski/BackendForFullstackTodo)
